# Aztec-Network-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
Aztec is building a decentralized, privacy-focused network and the sequencer node is a key part of it. Running a sequencer helps produce and propose blocks using regular consumer hardware. A privacy-focused Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution on the Ethereum blockchain. Aztec aims to enhance privacy and scalability for Ethereum transactions using zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, enabling private smart contract execution and confidential transactions. Their mission is to make privacy a standard feature for decentralized applications (dApps), addressing what they see as a critical gap in blockchain security and user protection.

In the Aztec network, three types of nodes can be run: Full Node, Sequencer Node, and Prover Node. Currently, only the Sequencer Node can be run on the Aztec Testnet. If you wish to run a different type of node, please refer to the official documentation linked below.

- Full Node: [Check Out](https://docs.aztec.network/next/the_aztec_network/guides/run_nodes/how_to_run_full_node)  
- Sequencer Node: [Check Out](https://docs.aztec.network/next/the_aztec_network/guides/run_nodes/how_to_run_sequencer) 
- Prover Node: [Check Out](https://docs.aztec.network/next/the_aztec_network/guides/run_nodes/how_to_run_prover)

## Key Features
- Privacy: Confidential transactions and smart contracts via zero-knowledge proofs.
- Scalability: ZK-rollups reduce gas fees and boost throughput.
- Noir Language: Rust-based language for secure, private contracts.
- Hybrid Execution: Supports public and private dApp logic.
- Decentralized Sequencers: Community-run nodes for network resilience.
- Developer Tools: Aztec Playground and Sandbox for building private dApps.
